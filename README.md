<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Quickly screenshot][screenshot]](https://github.com/ttomovcik/quickly)

I seriously don't know how to describe a To-Do app. Like - oh, you type stuff that you want to do eventually and this app reminds you to do so. Idk fellas. This readme will be updated later.

### Features
* It can show you stuff you saved
* Idk, works?


### Built With
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Want to customize Quicly or just get the lastest version from GitHub? Look no mo' fam. We got you covered.

### Prerequisites

Here's what you're gonna need.
* Android Studio
* AVD or phone running Android.

### Installation

1. Make sure you have Android Studio 3.x installed with Build tools 29.0.0
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https:://github.com/ttomovcik/quickly.git
```
3. Import this project into Android Studio
```sh

## Usage

If you really don't know how to use a To-Do app, I have no idea how to help you. Except:

Or the [_**projects tab**_](https://github.com/ttomovcik/quickly/projects) for a list of stuff that's being currently worked on). All the magic is happening in the _**develop/**_ branch. Only stable code in in the _**master/**_ branch.
